# Solver for Games Magazine Pool Problem

See page 33 of the December 2022 edition of Games Magazine for a problem
description

This program assumes that long sides of the pool table are each considered
to be single rails (instead of being two different rails separated by the
side pocket).

It should be general enough for all layouts but I have only tested the
problem given in the magazine

Look at __main__ code in solver.py to see how to run this program.
